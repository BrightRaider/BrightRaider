BRIGHTRAIDER — SCREENSHOT DESCRIPTIONS
================================================================================
These screenshots are needed for the GitHub README and marketing posts.
Ionas needs to capture them from Arc Raiders gameplay.

================================================================================

SCREENSHOT 1: "Before/After Comparison" (HERO IMAGE — most important!)
Filename: screenshot_comparison.png
Description:
    Split-screen or side-by-side:
    LEFT:  Dark cave/building in Arc Raiders, enemies barely visible
    RIGHT: Same scene with BrightRaider Bright profile active, enemies clearly visible
    Add text overlay: "Normal" on left, "BrightRaider" on right
Usage: README hero image, Reddit post, Discord

SCREENSHOT 2: "Tray Menu"
Filename: screenshot_menu.png
Description:
    Show the BrightRaider tray menu open, with profiles visible
    Profile 2 (Bright) should be checked/active
    Keep it clean — just the menu, no other windows
Usage: README features section

SCREENSHOT 3: "Profile Editor" (PRO)
Filename: screenshot_editor.png
Description:
    Show the Profile Editor dialog with custom values
    Have a few profiles with different gamma/contrast/vibrance settings
    Shows the customization depth of Pro
Usage: README Pro section

SCREENSHOT 4: "Auto-Brightness in Action" (PRO)
Filename: screenshot_auto.png
Description:
    Show the Debug Overlay active during gameplay
    Measurement zones visible on screen
    Brightness values displayed
    Ideally in a transition moment (entering dark area)
Usage: README Auto-Brightness section

SCREENSHOT 5: "Dark Cave Gameplay"
Filename: screenshot_dark.png
Description:
    Pure Arc Raiders screenshot — dark cave or underground area
    Enemies or loot barely visible
    This is the "problem" shot — shows why you need BrightRaider
Usage: Reddit/Discord post as context

================================================================================
TIPS FOR IONAS:
- Use Windows Snipping Tool (Win+Shift+S) or Print Screen
- For the comparison shot: Take screenshot with Numpad 1 (Normal),
  then same spot with Numpad 2 (Bright), combine in Paint/Photoshop
- Resolution: at least 1920x1080
- Save as PNG (no compression artifacts)
- The Before/After comparison is by far the most important one!
