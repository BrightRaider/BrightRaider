BRIGHTRAIDER — VOICEOVER SCRIPT (30-60 Seconds)
================================================================================

TARGET: Short demo video for Reddit / YouTube / Discord
TONE: Casual, confident, gamer-to-gamer
SHOW: Arc Raiders gameplay switching between dark/bright in real-time

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[0s - DARK GAMEPLAY — player in cave/building, enemies barely visible]

"Can't see anything in Arc Raiders? You're not alone."

[5s - PRESS NUMPAD 2 — screen gets brighter, enemies visible]

"One keypress. That's it."

[8s - SHOW TRAY ICON briefly, then back to gameplay]

"BrightRaider adjusts your display brightness, contrast and color
with a single hotkey. No alt-tab, no game files touched."

[16s - SWITCH BETWEEN PROFILES — Numpad 1, 2, 3 in quick succession]

"Three profiles. Numpad 1 is normal. Numpad 2 for dark areas.
Numpad 3 when you need maximum visibility."

[24s - SHOW AUTO-BRIGHTNESS: player walks from bright outdoor into dark cave]

"Pro version does it automatically. Walk into a cave — brightness goes up.
Step outside — back to normal. Hands stay on the keyboard."

[35s - QUICK FLASH: Settings menu, profile editor]

"Works with NVIDIA and AMD. No installation, just one 64 KB file."

[42s - FINAL SHOT: Side-by-side dark vs bright, enemy clearly visible]

"Safe with all anti-cheat. EAC, BattlEye, Vanguard — no problem.
It's just a monitor setting, but faster."

[50s - END CARD: BrightRaider logo + download link]

"BrightRaider. Free on GitHub. Link in the description."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOTAL: ~50 seconds
NOTES:
- Keep cuts fast, no dead air
- Show the hotkey presses as on-screen overlay (Numpad 1/2/3)
- Side-by-side comparison at the end is the money shot
- Background music: something chill/electronic, low volume
